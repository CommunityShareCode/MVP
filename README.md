This is the first part of the MVP demo, we're going to look into the Model Layer, which following a Repository Pattern.
You can't run this demo, because we haven't touched the Domain & Presentation Layer.  However you can go ahead and test
this layer.  Change the "Test Artifact" inside "Build Variant" to "Unit Test".

This also prove that this approaches make our code easily testable.
